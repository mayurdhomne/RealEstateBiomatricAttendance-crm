 * This test suite includes:
 * - Unit tests for repository classes and business logic
 * - Integration tests for API calls and database operations
 * - Performance tests for biometric operations and database queries
 * - Security tests for token handling and data encryption
 * - UI tests are run separately as Android instrumentation tests
