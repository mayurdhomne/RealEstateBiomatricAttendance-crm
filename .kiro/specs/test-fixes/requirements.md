# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing compilation errors in the Real Estate Biometric Attendance Android project test suite. The project has multiple test files with various compilation issues including missing imports, incorrect type usage, missing methods, and inconsistent assertion libraries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to compile successfully, so that I can run the test suite and ensure code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling the test suite THEN all Result.Success type arguments SHALL be properly specified
2. WHEN using Result.Success in tests THEN the generic type parameter SHALL be explicitly provided
3. WHEN asserting test results THEN consistent assertion libraries SHALL be used throughout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want correct import statements in all test files, so that all dependencies are properly resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing AppDatabase THEN the correct package path SHALL be used (com.crm.realestate.database.AppDatabase)
2. WHEN importing entity classes THEN the correct package paths SHALL be used
3. WHEN importing DAO classes THEN the correct package paths SHALL be used
4. WHEN using assertion methods THEN the correct JUnit imports SHALL be used instead of kotlin.test

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all DAO methods referenced in tests to exist, so that database integration tests can run successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests reference getOfflineAttendanceById method THEN the method SHALL exist in OfflineAttendanceDao
2. WHEN tests reference database methods THEN all referenced methods SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN tests use database entities THEN the entities SHALL be properly accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent API response types in tests, so that repository tests match the actual implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing AuthRepository THEN NetworkLoginResponse SHALL be used instead of LoginResponse
2. WHEN mocking API responses THEN the correct response types SHALL be used
3. WHEN testing API integration THEN response types SHALL match the actual API service definitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper null safety handling in tests, so that nullable types are handled correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing nullable properties THEN safe call operators (?.) or non-null assertions (!!.) SHALL be used
2. WHEN testing with nullable values THEN proper null handling SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN asserting on nullable types THEN appropriate null checks SHALL be performed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper coroutine scope usage in performance tests, so that async operations are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using async in tests THEN proper coroutine scope SHALL be provided
2. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN coroutineScope or runBlocking SHALL wrap async calls
3. WHEN testing performance THEN deprecated async usage SHALL be replaced with scoped alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing properties and constants to be available in test classes, so that all test assertions can be performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests reference 'reason' property THEN the property SHALL exist in the relevant data classes
2. WHEN tests reference QUICK_RETRY_CONFIG THEN the constant SHALL be defined
3. WHEN tests access object properties THEN all referenced properties SHALL be available

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type inference in mock setups, so that all test mocks are properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating mocks with type parameters THEN explicit types SHALL be specified where needed
2. WHEN setting up mock responses THEN type inference issues SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN configuring test doubles THEN all type parameters SHALL be properly defined
